Hi Optile, thank you for the challenge, really enjoyed working on it. For some reason, the api key wasn't working to get daily updates so just used what i could.

#Libraries used
Material- ui - was used for app styling, buttons and grid layouts, etc
React Charts - is a very nice library based of chartjs and it's used to create charts quicky in react 
react-redux -helps us store the application state
axios- helps us easily fetch data and get errors
react moment -helps us easily format the date
